# employee_rating_project
Monthly employee rating of a startup company. 

Three variables are considered :
                                 1. Attendence
                                 2. Timing of Slack Upload
                                 3. Works Done

Attendence rating is calculated using the mean attendence and is scaled from 0 to 9
Timing is calculated using the median time of upload ( Median is used beacuse there are joinees in between)
Works done is calculated using NLP 

Total Rating is taken as an average of the 3 ratings.
